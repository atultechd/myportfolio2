 My name is Peet Kent. I’m a salesperson at Lord’s Fashion House. I have three years’ experience in sales and marketing. I’ve helped generate a lot of apparel sales that intern contributed to our fashion store’s growth. I see myself as a relentless problem-solver who doesn’t shy away from a new challenge. I’m getting in touch with you because I’ve developed a high interest in your company S&M Apparel and I’ve heard great things about how your sales department operates. Given my experience in sales, I’m confident I can be a great asset to your company.

I’d love to arrange a meeting with you to discuss your needs in the sales and marketing area and determine whether you’d be interested in bringing me in as a new sales member of your team. You can reach me via email at example@email.com in case of any questions.

  Thanks for your time. I look forward to hearing from you.
