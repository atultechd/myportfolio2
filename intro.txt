My name is Atul Dwivedi.I was born and brought up in Delhi where I finished my schooling in 2019 from GBSSS Roop Nagar-2 and I am currently persuing Engineering in Electronics and Communication from Bharati Vidyapeeth's college of engineering.

I like watching movies, at least once a week. I love to play Badminton and Chess whenever I get time. I’m into reading novels as well, Robert kiyosaki being my favorite novelist.

I’m happy to step into college life, which provides more freedom and where, finally, I don’t have to come in a uniform. Post-college, I aspire to work in Software/IT industry.

I’m particularly strong in Backend development and creating well-developed websites. If anyone requires support in these areas, I’ll be glad to help. I look forward to meeting each one of you in the coming days.
